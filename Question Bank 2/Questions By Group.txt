[0:01 pm, 04/04/2022] +91 90044 72578: What is ENI?
[0:06 pm, 04/04/2022] +91 97662 55755: Elastic network interface. 

It is attached to our ec2 instance. All the networking properties we give to our instance are attached to ENI actually. Like IP address, VPC etc. 
For every instance you launch by default ENI is created and attached to ur instance.
You can see that in "Network Interfaces" in EC2 console.
